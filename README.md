# DesGolf
Specification and web-based interpreter for a code golfing language based on Desmos. I'll definitely get around to finishing this one this time, most probably!

Specification in `Function Table.tsv` is _very_ WIP and sometimes intentionally vague. Encoding is currently ISO 8859-15, with a possible extension in the future. Files are currently encoded in UTF-8 for compatability.

Features:

✔: Implemented  
❌: Not implemented  
❓: Not certain yet  
🕛: In progress  

✔ Arbitrary precision numbers via Decimal.js  
✔ 4-function calculations respecting order of operations  
🕛 Full PEMDAS  
❌ Function support  
❌ Implicit multiplication  
❌ Extended trigonometric functions  
❌ Radians/degrees mode  
❌ Math constants  
❌ Assorted math functions  
❌ Debug function  
❌ Arrays  
❌ Array functions  
❌ Implict array calculations  
❌ Strings  
❌ Explicit string conversion  
❌ Input/variables  
❌ Multiple inputs  
❌ Piecewise functions  
❌ Summation/Product notation  
❓ Calculus  
❓ Nested arrays  
❓ Meaningful 0-length functions
